<p style="color: whitesmoke;">Today i created this blog,  i am going to talk about what 
    is happening around me. I am listening currently to my dog snoring and birds screaming at eachother, there is a kid playing
    in the house next to me very loudly aswell. I really hate the part of my arm that is coming in contact with the desk my computer
    is sitting at, its frustrating me alot for reasons such as the slight pain that keeps hitting me as i type each key. 
</p>
<br>
<p style="color: whitesmoke;">The snoring has been continued by another one of my dogs and they are now snoring together in an awful symphony of air. 
    The air i am breathing is very nice, when i inhale it is clear and filtered with not dirt or grime but clear purity. 
    The child seems to have settled down quite a bit as i can no longer hear them, maybe a slight squak but that is all.
    Around 20-30 minutes before i wrote this i heard the father (or some form of male adult) talking to the child.
    Ough. The child just squeled so terribly loud, eugh eugh eught. That was awful, the loud ruckus invaded my peaceful house in lots 
    of hurtful purposeful attacks. Wow, just wow.
</p>

<p style="color: whitesmoke;">God my dog has awoken and is barking so annoyingly loud. A plane is flying overhead me aswell. Ohgh somebody 
    is screaming and it is not the child, sounds like either a woman or an alien. Im not sure. I wish aliens gave me a visit
    so i could feel what it is like to incorporate myself into alien society. I hope aliens arent silly little bugs and they
    are actaully like in the movies with big heads and eyes and they talk in nonsense. Dreams like this silly matter will never
    truly exist because the thought of my dreaming coming to life has the smallest chance possible, because there are infinite
    dreams. Somebodys dream could be for the gods to save them and somebody elses could be for their cat to morph into an xenomorph
    and they would both have the same chance because there are infinite dreams. No. Maybe that is true but i dont know, what youve 
    said is pretty rubbish to me, like say if my dream was that i wished my microwave would make a ding after 30 seconds and i turned
    it on for 30 seconds and it dinged, that has a far higher chance then aliens coming because its destined to happen. Oh god the 
    child and their father are back, just kill me.

<p style="color: whitesmoke;">Your argument is good and i think you have me beaten. Goodbye. C2400/W456/P4/xan.entry(4.19.25)</p>
