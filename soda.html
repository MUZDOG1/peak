<p>Today created this blog, which is why this entry is the biggest book out of them all, i am going to talk about what 
    is happening around me. I am listening currently to my dog snoring and birds screaming at eachother, there is a kid playing
    in the house next to me very loudly aswell. I really hate the part of my arm that is coming in contact with the desk my computer
    is sitting at, its frustrating me alot for reasons such as the slight pain that keeps hitting me as i type each key.

<p>The snoring has been continued by another one of my dogs and they are now snoring together in an awful symphony of air. 
    The air i am breathing is very nice, when i inhale it is clear and filtered with not dirt or grime but clear purity. 
    The child seems to have settled down quite a bit as i can no longer hear them, maybe a slight squak but that is all.
    Around 20-30 minutes before i wrote this i heard the father (or some form of male adult) talking to the child.
    Ough. The child just squeled so terribly loud, eugh eugh eught. That was awful, the loud ruckus invaded my peaceful house in lots 
    of hurtful purposeful attacks. Wow, just wow.
