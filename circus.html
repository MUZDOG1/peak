<h1>the circus and my dinosaur</h1>
<p>i went to the circus today, it wasnt the best compared to other circus type events i have been too but i still enjoyed it very much. I think the normalization of fun gatherings
    such as a circus has been very good on not only peoples mental states, but the economy aswell. The circus buisness has been flourishing since 1768, which is okay. The dinosaur
    keeps coming through and i dont know why, its so annoying, why does the general population love the dinosaur? argh ah ro dinosaur dinosaur they chant, the dinosaur is annoying
    and i much preferred the lizard, even if they were "lying". I hate this new change and i wish it could go back to normal.

<p>what youve said is fine but i dont agree, the dinosaur isnt all that bad, yes they do things you dont like but why let that paint the entire picture of the dinosaur, goodbye xanlack!
