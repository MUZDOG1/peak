<h1>the circus and my dinosaur</h1>
<p>i went to the circus today, it wasnt the best compared to other circus type events i have been too but i still enjoyed it very much. I think the normalization of fun gatherings
    such as a circus has been very good on not only peoples mental states, but the economy aswell. The circus buisness has been flourishing since 1768, which is okay. The dinosaur
    keeps coming through and i dont know why, its so annoying, why does the general population love the dinosaur? argh ah ro dinosaur dinosaur they chant, the dinosaur is annoying
    and i much preferred the lizard, even if they were "lying". I hate this new change and i wish it could go back to normal.

<p>what youve said is fine but i dont agree, the dinosaur isnt all that bad, yes they do things you dont like but why let that paint the entire picture of the dinosaur, goodbye xanlack!

<p>it seems like  the turkey and the giraffe are positive sredole interferance throughout eachother, but they both know they embrace trandar at eachother, while everyone
    loves the girrafe even though it really really SUCKS! THE FUCKING GIRAFFE IS THE MOST GOD AWFUL FUCKING THING THE TURKEY HAS EVER HAD TO ENDURE, AND ITS LIKE THE GIRAFFE
    IS PURPOSELY MAKING THE FUCKING TURKEY SEEM BAD WHEN ITS THE OPPOSITE BECAUSE THE GIRAFFE FUCKINBG SUCKS SO MUCH, AND ITS NOT THAT THE TURKEY HAS ALWAYS FELT
    THIS WAY, THE GIRRAFE MADE THE FUCKING TURKEY FEEL THIS WAY, AND NOW ALL THE ANIMALS IN THE KINGDOM THINK THE GIRRAFE IS GREAT, BUT DUE TO SOCIAL LAWS THE TURKEY 
    CANT JUST SAY "I FUCKING HATE YOU" BECAUSE THEN GUESS WHOS THE FUCKASS VILLIAN! THE TURKEY, THE TURKEY THEN SEEMS LIKE ITS A DICK! THE TURKEY IS FINE.
