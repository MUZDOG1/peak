<h1>book review</h1>
<p>i finished the outsiders yesterday and i must say it was an absolute snoozefest, i seriously didnt find anything
    other then the clever ending funny, amusing or interesting, it was purely just tolerable. The book is around 130-140 pages long
    which was a nice move by my english teacher so i didnt have to slave away my holidays reading an awfully long book that 
    doesnt interest me, 130 pages is toddler work so i didnt bother starting it until around two days ago. One thing i did like
    about the book was that it was very readable, some authors are very bad at making their books enjoyable to the mind and eyes.
    The book itself is about two rival gangs called "the socs" and "the greasers", its a basic topic but i think the author
    pulled it off very well, even though it didnt interest me. I will not go into further details so i refrain from spoiling the book.
    I would give this book maybe a 6/10, not the worst but far from the best, i would recommend reading something like "it, stephen king" or 
    christine which is also a stephen king, but if you want something of a similiar theme i wouldnt have a clue. I am however excited
    about the next book we are reading which is "frankenstein, mary shelley". this book is of far more value to me. Goodbye.
