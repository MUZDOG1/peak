  <h1 style="text-align: center;">welcome.</h1>
  <br> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">if you are seeing this you have either found it by accident or you have looked through my code, which 
      i really hope you havent (dick move) anyway im just making this to share a little something straight from 
      my soul, a truth i dont tell many other people about. 
  </h2>
  <br> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">i am so bored. with life and everything, nothing excites me no matter how hard i try to enjoy myself. 
      this pathetic plain known as earth traps my soul from the real me and my true form. there is no escape for me.
  </h2>
  <br> 
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">my daily life drains me of my soul, yet without my daily life my soul could never exist. life
      is pointless to me and i hope you understand my words. there will never be an end for any of this, i am lost in my own 
      brain. 
  </h2>
  <br>
  <h2 style="text-align: center;">so many of my limited hours have been spent pondering why i was chosen to die in this world, i
    dont want to die a human life, i wish to excel further then the normalizied standard, but that is not possible for me. it 
    weakens me to think nobody will know me in a hundred years, nobody will know you in a hundred years, but that is our life.
    run along friend, you too will die soon. goodbye. 3/24/2025
  </h2>
