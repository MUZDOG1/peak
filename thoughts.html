    <p>Notification functionality is finally here! You most likely got a prompt asking you to enable notifications, but incase
        you didnt or you want to turn them off, heres how to do that! There should be a small cog/lock icon next to the url of 
        muzdog chat, click on that and navigate to the notification settings. Have fun with muzdog chats newest feature :D
