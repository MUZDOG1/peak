<p>nice job, you found the first puzzle piece into the end goal of your test, which is enhanced features 
  and testing new ones. 
</p>
<p>but before i give you the clue, there is seven people right there! lol</p>
<p>look at the homepage of muzdog chat, look real hard, look at all the crevices and the cracks.
  on the homepage there is a line that will send you to the next clue, could be a secret image, link, code
  or whatever i want, maybe even in the code?
