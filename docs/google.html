    <h1>Why does muzdog chat not come up on google?</h1>
    <p>currently, muzdog chat will not come up on google because of googles slow search features for small sites. however, you 
        can find us on bing as the top search! (thanks bing!!). if we want muzdog chat to be on the top search on google, we will
        need alot of people to sign up and visit the site frequently, but i believe we can achieve that!
