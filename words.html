<h4>hey cowboy i get it, you want some codes and thats reasonable but do you see that big red ball of flesh just below me. thats my heart man and if you click the continue 
    button your basically taking a knife, a really pointy knife and just stabbing me over and over and over again until i die. these codes mean alot to me and for you to just violate
    them is like you taking a piss on me, so just think before you continue.
