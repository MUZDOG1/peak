    <p style="text-align: center;">H tags (header tags) are used to create titles and headers, it starts at h1 (most important) all the way down to h6 (least important). These go in pair with p tags which 
        are used to display large amounts of text and paragraphs. There are also br texts (break texts). These split up texts by adding a big gap in between each tag, similar to br 
        tags, there are hr tags, which are used to add a big line inbetween each text. All of these things are crucial to your websites growth.
