<h1 style="text-align: center;">MUZDOG CHAT TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
<h3>ok so this is my chatrooms terms of service, aka rules. im just gonna say that this isnt going to be very professional cuz
    its really late and i cant be bothered to write some big rant, but hey i could of gone to chatgpt or any of those other ai bots
    but NO! your getting this straight from the source so be grateful you ungrateful scum! wait no i dont mean that but im also not 
    going to delete that because i think it really shows how much work im putting into this awesome terms of service page and you 
    know this whole site in general!!!! BE GRATEFUL PELASD PLEASE.

    so the next thing i want to say is that those words (yes those words) the bad ones that offend alot of people are NOT allowed 
    at all, they are the most awful disgusting things i have ever heard and they make me want to rip out my veins, the punishment
    for this wrong-doing will be eternal! i will personally meet you in HELL! no but really on your first offence i might ban your 
    ip for a week or two and your second offence oh buddy you are DONE! You will NEVER be able to enter my site EVER again EVER! dont
    even think about it, i mean its not that hard to just not say them so if you do you must be a word addict or something and u 
    prolly need to get into rehab.
