<h1 style="text-align: center;">MUZDOG CHAT TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
<h3>ok so this is my chatrooms terms of service, aka rules. im just gonna say that this isnt going to be very professional cuz
    its really late and i cant be bothered to write some big rant, but hey i could of gone to chatgpt or any of those other ai bots
    but NO! your getting this straight from the source so be grateful you ungrateful scum! wait no i dont mean that but im also not 
    going to delete that because i think it really shows how much work im putting into this awesome terms of service page and you 
    know this whole site in general!!!! BE GRATEFUL PELASD PLEASE.

</h3>

<br> 

<h3> so the next thing i want to say is that those words (yes those words) the bad ones that offend alot of people are NOT allowed 
    at all, they are the most awful disgusting things i have ever heard and they make me want to rip out my veins, the punishment
    for this wrong-doing will be eternal! i will personally meet you in HELL! no but really on your first offence i might ban your 
    ip for a week or two and your second offence oh buddy you are DONE! You will NEVER be able to enter my site EVER again EVER! dont
    even think about it, i mean its not that hard to just not say them so if you do you must be a word addict or something and u 
    prolly need to get into rehab. ps i also forgot ask me if you want to test swear words</h3>

<br>

<h3>um so im already getting bored but i have to thug this out so it can be done and readable but another thing i will NOT 
    tolerate is like bots n stuff cuz the database i use have a limited amount of read and writes which is enough for like 20 actual 
    people to be using it but like if someone spammed bots and stuff that would really ruin the site so if anyone does this you will be
    banned forever, no warnings. so yarh dont break that rule or i will be very angry. >:D
</h3>

<br> 

<h3>next thing, pretty obvious but if your going to use this at school do not let a teacher see you use it, say a teacher is walking 
    round the corner or something, just close the tab. that simple, there is no punishment for breaking this but please just dont do 
    it cuz the teachers will prolly be all pissy. if you do somehow get caught just say like your testing murrays coding project, then 
    tell me that you got caught, i wont care but like ill just wipe the database for everyones privacy.
