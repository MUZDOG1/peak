    <p style="text-align: center; color: white;"> stardate 4/19/2025. the locker of xanlacks thoughts will not be tampered with at all, not by anyone but xanlack because if it was tampered with that
        wouldnt make it xanlacks mind it would make it anyones mind, a open realm which would be useless. so far by the time somebody 
        reads this there will be one to two thoughts for you to digest, which isnt a lot but it should do for now. i will update
        this text once this information becomes invalid, which shouldnt happen for a decent twelve - thirty-four days.
